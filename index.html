<section class="punch">
	<p>Following recent developments within Ireland, throughout Europe, and worldwide relating to COVID-19, the OWASP Foundation has made the difficult, but considered decision, to postpone the Global AppSec Dublin set to take place June 15-19.</p>
	<p>We take pride in offering a premier experience for our attendees and sponsors and we can no longer guarantee that event quality. Nor can we ethically put our community’s health and safety at risk. Therefore we have secured dates at the Convention Center Dublin to hold the Global AppSec Dublin on February 15-19, 2021.</p>
	<p>We are working on ways to still deliver value to the OWASP community in 2020. While we continue to monitor the situation, we are confident that the Global AppSec San Francisco will still take place October 19-23, 2020. Call for papers will be open March 23.</p>
	<p>Our thoughts are with those affected around the world, we hope this situation improves soon and we thank you for your support.</p>
	<!--
	<p>Welcome to Global AppSec Dublin 2020 presented by the OWASP Foundation.</p>
	<p>Formerly known as AppSec EU, the Global AppSec Conference is the premier application security conference for developers and security experts. Designed for private and public sector infosec professionals, the OWASP three day training and two day conference equips developers, defenders, and advocates to build a more secure web.</p>
	<p>Join us for a celebration of leading application security technologies, speakers, prospects, and community, in a unique event that will build on everything you already know to expect from an OWASP Global Conference.</p>
