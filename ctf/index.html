<h1>Test your skills on the CMD+CTRL Cyber Range</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.securityinnovation.com/" target="_blank">Security Innovation</a> is proud to join&nbsp;<strong>Virtual AppSec Indonesia&nbsp;</strong>again in 2020 to host a unique and challenging CTF featuring our <a href="https://web.securityinnovation.com/owasp-appsec-indonesia" target="_blank">CMD+CTRL Cyber Range</a>.</p>
<h2>What is a Cyber Range?</h2>
<p>CMD+CTRL Cyber Ranges are intentionally vulnerable applications and websites that tempt players to steal money, find out their boss&rsquo;s salary, purchase costly items for free, and conduct other nefarious acts. Hundreds of vulnerabilities, common to most business applications, lay waiting to be exploited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each vulnerability you find you'll be awarded points (based on the level of difficulty) that will be charted on our live leaderboard. Top scorers get prizes, but all players have fun!</p>
